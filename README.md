# Fantasy Sports Data Analysis Toolkit

## Overview
This toolkit is designed for fantasy sports enthusiasts and analysts who want to dive deep into player performance data. Leveraging the power of Python and pandas, it provides a set of tools for analyzing and visualizing fantasy sports data, particularly focusing on the comparison of expected and actual performance of players across different weeks.

## Features
The toolkit includes the following functions:

1. **`calculate_regression_slope`**: Calculates the slope of the linear regression line for a player's weekly stats.

2. **`calculate_slope`**: Processes multiple DataFrames representing weekly fantasy sports data, calculates regression slopes for both expected and actual points, and returns a DataFrame with these slopes for each player.

3. **`plot_player_regression`**: Visualizes the regression lines for both expected and actual points of a specific player, allowing for a direct comparison of their performance over a specified number of recent weeks.

## Function Descriptions

### `calculate_regression_slope`
This function calculates the slope of the linear regression line for a given player's weekly stats. It requires a pandas Series containing numeric values representing a player's performance over several weeks.

#### Usage
```python
slope = calculate_regression_slope(player_weekly_stats)
```

### `calculate_slope`
This function merges multiple DataFrames containing weekly fantasy sports data, then calculates and compares the regression slopes for both expected and actual points for each player. It requires a list of DataFrames, the number of recent weeks to consider, and the minimum number of games a player must have to be included in the analysis.

#### Usage
```python
slope_df = calculate_slope(dataframes, recent_weeks=10, min_games=5)
```

### `plot_player_regression`
This function visualizes the regression lines for both expected and actual points of a specific player. It provides a clear visual comparison of a player's expected performance against their actual performance over a certain number of recent weeks.

#### Usage
```python
plot_player_regression(dataframes, 'Player Name', recent_weeks=4)
```

## Example Visualizations
Here you can add images of the plots generated by the `plot_player_regression` function to visually demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities.

## Installation
To use this toolkit, ensure you have Python installed along with the pandas and matplotlib libraries. You can install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Data Requirements
The toolkit is designed to work with DataFrames where each row represents a player and columns represent their performance metrics across different weeks. Ensure your data is formatted accordingly for optimal results.

## Contributing
Contributions to this toolkit are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
